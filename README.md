  ## Description:
  ![](./index.png)

  This burger is for the burger lovers in the world. GitGitBurgers is an node express handlebars application deployed on heroku that allows users to markdown the burgers that they have eaten and the burgers they have their sights on next! 
  ## Installation: 
  To install: Fork the repository for your own use. If you would like to contribute to the project, clone the repo and follow the steps in the "Contributing" section below.
  ## Usage:
  To use the app, create the burger that has been on your mind at the bottom of the page. Once you have clicked 'Create' the page will refresh with your new burger displaying on the page. The burgers you have devoured will be displayed along with the burgers you aim to devour in the future. For the burgers that have yet to be conquered, there will be a devour button that will remove the burger from the list and replace it in the devoured burgers list. Each burger name will give you the option to delete and remove the burger from the database. This enables the user to remove burgers that didn't suit their taste or remove burgers that the user does not intend to eat anymore.
